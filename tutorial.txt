inital migration:
 * dotnet tool install --global dotnet -ef 
 * dotnet ef migrations add InitalCreate
 * dotnet ef database update

 ef migrations add InitialCreate: Generates an Migrations/{timestamp}_InitialCreate.cs migration file. 
 The InitialCreate argument is the migration name. 
 Any name can be used, but by convention, a name is selected that describes the migration. 
 Because this is the first migration, the generated class contains code to create the database schema. 
 The database schema is based on the model specified in the MvcMovieContext class (in the Data/MvcMovieContext.cs file).

ef database update: Updates the database to the latest migration, which the previous command created. 
This command runs the Up method in the Migrations/{time-stamp}_InitialCreate.cs file, which creates the database.
